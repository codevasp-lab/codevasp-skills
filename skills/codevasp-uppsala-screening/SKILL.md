# CodeVASP Uppsala Screening Integration Guide

## Overview

This skill provides the AI agent with the necessary procedures, references, and validation instructions to assist developers integrating with the CodeVASP Uppsala Screening APIs. These APIs, jointly operated by CodeVASP and Uppsala Security, detect risks associated with **wallet addresses** and **blockchain transactions (KYT)**.

- **Wallet Screening**: Synchronous API returning risk levels (`BLACK`, `GRAY`, `WHITE`, `UNKNOWN`) and security tags.
- **KYT (Know Your Transaction)**: Asynchronous API returning a detailed analysis report with a verdict of `Clean`, `Suspicious`, or `Malicious`.

> **Important**: The Wallet Screening API does **not** support the development environment. The KYT API supports both development and production environments.

## Folder Architecture & Resource Map

Before responding to user queries, consult the appropriate resources in the `references/` directory. Be explicit in your responses about which file or standard you are referencing.

### 1. API Reference (`references/api/`)
- `01-Uppsala-Wallet-Screening.md`: API for screening a wallet address for risk. Returns `securityCategory` and `securityTags`.
- `02-Uppsala-KYT-Introduction.md`: Overview of the KYT integration workflow, prerequisites, headers, host URLs, and callback IP whitelist.
- `03-Uppsala-KYT-Development-Environment.md`: Supported networks, preset test cases, and response behaviors for the KYT dev environment.
- `04-Uppsala-KYT-Search.md`: API for submitting a KYT analysis request (`POST /v1/code/uppsala/kytsearch`). Returns `requestId` and initial `status`.
- `05-Uppsala-KYT-Report.md`: API for polling the KYT analysis result (`GET /v1/code/uppsala/kytreport`). Returns full report with `verdict`, `riskIndicators`, `annotations`, and `byToken`.
- `06-Uppsala-KYT-Callback.md`: Callback specification delivered to `callbackUrl` when KYT analysis completes.

## Instructions

When the user requests assistance with CodeVASP Uppsala Screening integrations, adhere rigorously to the following workflows:

### Workflow 1: Answering FAQ & Conceptual Questions
1. Always start by scanning the relevant reference file(s) to find authoritative answers.
2. **Wallet Screening risk levels**: Explain the four security categories — `BLACK` (highly suspicious), `GRAY` (suspicious), `WHITE` (normal), `UNKNOWN` (unknown).
3. **KYT verdicts**: Explain the three verdicts — `Malicious` (blacklisted addresses found), `Suspicious` (suspicious patterns detected), `Clean` (no risk indicators).
4. **Environment availability**:
   - Wallet Screening: **production only** — no dev environment supported.
   - KYT: both **development** (`https://trapi-dev.codevasp.com`) and **production** (`https://trapi.codevasp.com`) are supported.
5. **KYT flow**: KYT Search returns a `requestId` immediately. Poll KYT Report until status is `RELEASED` or `FAILED`, or receive the result via callback if `callbackUrl` was provided.
6. For access requests or inquiries, direct the user to [partnership@codevasp.com](mailto:partnership@codevasp.com).
7. Keep answers concise. Point the developer to the relevant API reference file instead of explaining extensively.

### Workflow 2: Implementing Uppsala Screening
This skill supports VASP developers working on existing projects. The AI agent must maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

#### 2a. Wallet Screening (Ref: `01-Uppsala-Wallet-Screening.md`)
1. Use the **production** host URL only: `https://trapi.codevasp.com`.
2. Configure mandatory headers: `X-Code-Req-PubKey`, `X-Code-Req-Signature`, `X-Code-Req-Datetime`, `X-Code-Req-Nonce`, `X-Request-Origin`.
3. Call `POST /v1/code/upset/wallet` with body: `walletAddress` (string, required) and `chain` (string, required — e.g., `"ETH"`).
4. Parse the response: check `result` (`NORMAL` or `ERROR`), read `securityCategory` for risk level, inspect `securityTags` for threat labels.

#### 2b. KYT (Know Your Transaction) (Ref: `02-Uppsala-KYT-Introduction.md`, `04-Uppsala-KYT-Search.md`, `05-Uppsala-KYT-Report.md`, `06-Uppsala-KYT-Callback.md`)
Guide the developer through the following three-step flow:

1. **Submit KYT Search** (Ref: `04-Uppsala-KYT-Search.md`):
   - Call `POST /v1/code/uppsala/kytsearch` with body: `txHash` (string, required), `blockchain` (string, required), `force` (boolean, optional, default `false`), `callbackUrl` (string, optional HTTPS URL).
   - The `txHash` must be a **confirmed** transaction. The `blockchain` must match the actual chain of the transaction.
   - Response: `requestId` (integer) and `status` (`PENDING` or `RELEASED`).
   - If `RELEASED`, a cached result was found — proceed directly to KYT Report to fetch the full report.

2. **Poll KYT Report** (Ref: `05-Uppsala-KYT-Report.md`):
   - Call `GET /v1/code/uppsala/kytreport?requestId={requestId}` at 5–10 second intervals.
   - Status values: `PENDING` (still processing), `RELEASED` (complete — `report` field populated), `FAILED` (failed — `error` field populated).
   - Parse the `report`: check `verdict` (`Clean`, `Suspicious`, `Malicious`), inspect `riskIndicators` for `blacklistedAddresses`, `suspiciousServices`, `behavioralPatterns`, `transactionPatterns`, and `mlFeatures`.

3. **Receive Callback (optional)** (Ref: `06-Uppsala-KYT-Callback.md`):
   - If `callbackUrl` was provided, the result is delivered via `POST` once the status becomes `RELEASED` or `FAILED`. The body matches the KYT Report response format.
   - Callbacks are sent **once only** — no retries. Keep KYT Report polling as a fallback.
   - Whitelist CodeVASP server IPs: Dev — `3.35.100.55/32`, `13.209.222.19/32`, `211.245.36.156/32`; Prod — `3.37.135.89/32`.

### Workflow 3: Request Payload Validation
If the user provides a request payload to validate:

#### Wallet Screening
1. Verify required fields: `walletAddress`, `chain`.
2. Confirm `chain` is one of the supported values: BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, TRX, EOS, XLM, ADA, BNB, BCH, XRP, BSC, KLAY, DASH, DOGE, ZEC, FTM, MATIC, AVAX.

#### KYT Search
1. Verify required fields: `txHash`, `blockchain`.
2. Confirm `blockchain` is one of the supported network codes (refer to `04-Uppsala-KYT-Search.md` for the full list including ETH, BTC, TRX, SOL, MATIC, BSC, etc.).
3. If `callbackUrl` is present, confirm it is a valid HTTPS URL.
4. Provide feedback with line-item precision on any missing required fields, unsupported blockchain values, or invalid URLs.

### Workflow 4: KYT Development Environment Testing (Ref: `03-Uppsala-KYT-Development-Environment.md`)
If the user asks about testing KYT in the development environment:
1. Dev host: `https://trapi-dev.codevasp.com`. Only ETH and BTC are supported.
2. Use the preset test cases to trigger specific outcomes:
   - **Clean**: `blockchain: "ETH"`, `txHash: "0x5028a06f62bd79cd44d96779c5d1db68882ede90c3cbf62b6cc11a6218984063"`
   - **Suspicious**: `blockchain: "BTC"`, `txHash: "6db6a29832732e9c6f19ea8f85150ffe1deafa8412654b0be4f4a532a876fff6"`
   - **Malicious**: `blockchain: "ETH"`, `txHash: "0x091d6e123c64e8ce9c0f39a9085d6adcf29cf8f49c888a95c128566550765298"`
3. Any other pair returns `FAILED` with `"Tx hash not found"`.
4. `requestId` is valid for 5 minutes in the dev environment.

## Compliance Constraints
- **Do not invent instructions.** If something is not covered in the `references/` directories, inform the user that you cannot verify that specific detail and they should check the official CodeVASP Alliance documentation.
- Always refer to the network strictly as **CodeVASP**.
